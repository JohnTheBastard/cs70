 *
 * This file defines the interface to the ChunkyString class which is a linked list
 * of chunks, each storing a portion of a string. Included is the header for the
 * ChunkyStringIterator class.
 *
 * The ChunkyString class stores a single larger string inside a linked list of 
 * chunks, each of which contain an array of characters. The ChunkyString class 
 * acts as if it were a regular string, supporting a copy constructor, assignment
 * operator, concatenation of single characters, etc.
