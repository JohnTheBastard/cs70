Purpose of Program
------------------

This class provides the basic operations for rational numbers. This includes
arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and input and output methods.

I/O Format
----------

The class itself does not generate output on its own, however the test program
uses the input and output methods defined in the class.


General Structure
-----------------

The class is contained within two files. One file is rat.cc which contains
the actual implementation of the operators. The other file is rat.hh which 
is the header file for the class. 

Methods

	Arithmetic Operators: '+', '-', '*', '/', abs
	
	Comparison Operators: '<', '>', '=='

	Stream I/O Operators: '<<', '>>'

	Incremental Operators: '++', '+='  

	Greatest Common Divisor: gcd

	Normalize: normalize
		note: Normalize reduces fractional representation of 
			rational numbers

	Data Structures: rat class containing two integers (top and bot)
			 representing the numerator and denominator of
			 a rational number.

Algorithms

The program implements Euclid's Algorithm for finding the greatest common
divisor. The following is a description of the algorithm taken from
http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/chapter1/node16.html.


The idea of the algorithm is based on the observation that, if r is 
the remainder when a is divided by b, then the common divisors of a
and b are precisely the same as the common divisors of b and r.
Thus, we can use the equation

		GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)

to successively reduce the problem of computing a GCD to the problem
of computing the GCD of smaller and smaller pairs of integers.

For example,

GCD(206,40) = GCD(40,6)
            = GCD(6,4)
            = GCD(4,2)
            = GCD(2,0)
            = 2

reduces GCD(206,40) to GCD(2,0), which is 2.

It is possible to show that starting with any two positive integers
and performing repeated reductions will always eventually produce a
pair where the second number is 0. Then the GCD is the other number
in the pair. This method for computing the GCD is known as Euclid's
Algorithm.

	rat.hh - Header file for the rat class.

Limitations and Possible Improvements
-------------------------------------

Currently, there is no '*=' or '/=' operator for the rat class. The size of
the rational number stored is limited only by the storage space available
for an int.
