<H1>CS 70, Spring 2004 </H1>
<P> 
<H1> Administrivia</H1>
<P>

<HR>
<H3>Grading and Graded Work</H3>

<P>
There will be a mid-term and a final exam, stressing concepts rather
than memorization of details.  Both exams will be timed take-home tests.
There will be 11 homework
assignments, each taking between 1 and 2 weeks.

<P>
Final grades will be based on the following formula:

<UL>
    <LI> Mid-term exam: 15%
    <LI> Final exam: 20%
    <LI> Homeworks: 60%
	(<A HREF="homework-grading.html#throw-out">lowest submitted
	grade</A> will be thrown out)
    <LI> Class participation: 5%
</UL>

<HR>
<H3>Turning in Assignments</H3>

<P>
Homeworks will consist primarily of programming, with occasional
non-programming problems.  Homeworks will be submitted using the
program <CODE>cs70submit</CODE> or <CODE>cs70submitall</CODE>.  Note
that submission deadlines are <STRONG>firm</STRONG>.

<P>
All homework must be submitted on Turing, the department server.  That
means you must have a Turing account.  If you have never had a Turing
account, see one of the professor for an account-request form.  If
you used to have an account, but it is no longer active, see the
system administrator in Beckman B101 to get it
reactivated.  <STRONG>Be sure to fill out your request form
legibly.</STRONG>

<P>
Note that you can't get to
Turing using the <CODE>telnet</CODE> program; you must either use
<A HREF="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/tech_docs/qref/ssh.html">ssh</A> or go
to the terminal room, Beckman B102.

<P>
Full homework information is given on the <A
HREF="homework-policies.html">homework policies</A> and
<A HREF="homework-grading.html">homework grading</A> pages.
The lowest homework grade will be discarded before final grades are
calculated.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="missing-hw">Assignments Not Submitted</A></H3>

<P>
It is critical that you turn in <EM>all</EM> of your assignments.
Missing assignments are weighted very severely in the calculation of
your final grade.  Missing an assignment is far worse than turning one
in and getting a zero.
Most people who miss assignments wind up either dropping the course or
failing it.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="honor-code">Collaboration, Honor Code</A></H3>

<H4>Pair Programming</H4>

<P>
This semester, CS70 will use the popular <EM>pair programming</EM>
methodology for all homework assignments.  At the start of the
semester, the class will be divided into teams (pairs) who will work
together throughout the semester.  All homework will be done as a
pair, with a single, joint assignment turned in by one member of the
pair.

<P>
In the pair-programming model, you <EM>must</EM> spend the bulk of
your time working together as a team, with one person at the keyboard
and the other at their side watching.  All work should be a joint
effort.  <STRONG>You will be violating the honor code if you divide
the work such that you work separately with one person doing one half
of the work and the other person doing the other half.</STRONG>

<P>
There are times when the work to be done is "mindless", and it would
be a waste of your partner's time to watch you.  The standard example
is spell-checking a document.  In such cases, <STRONG>and only in such
cases</STRONG>, you are allowed to work alone.  If you're not sure
whether something falls under the "mindlessness" rule, ask.  In
general, if your partner can't understand what you did without
explanation, it wasn't mindless.

<H4>Other Questions of Collaboration</H4>
<P>
You are encouraged to discuss general features of the assignment and
the ideas involved with other students besides your partner (including
past CS70 students).  This might include general
approaches to the problems,
bugs in the specification, 
how long you've spent working on it, etc.
You can also help one another with questions of how to use Unix, C++, and the
like.  You can use example code, such as that in the textbooks or other
reference materials, as a starting point for designing your own code.

<P> 
However, except for your partner, you should
not discuss details of how you designed and implemented your algorithms,
or how you solved
mathematical problems.  You must not exchange literal copies of
material, whether it is code, program output, or English-language text
(e.g. documentation).  You also cannot copy material from published
or on-line sources, with or without cosmetic changes such as altering
variable names.  <STRONG>In particular, you are not allowed to copy
portions of the assignment Web pages directly into your README files
without attribution.</STRONG>

<P>
These principles are the same, no matter what 
the medium of discussion or exchange (voice, writing, email, etc).

<P>
A question that often arises in later assignments is whether code can
be copied from the textbook.  You are allowed to study and thoroughly
understand the textbook's solutions, but <STRONG>you may not copy code
from the book</STRONG>.  You must write your own code from scratch,
using the knowledge you gained from reading the book.

<P>
If you aren't sure what is permitted, explicitly document what you
did and, if at all possible, consult with the course staff.
Similarly, document what happened if you receive extensive or
particularly important help from
some source, even if it seems legitimate.  If the questionable
material or extensive help is explicitly marked as such, you might
lose points but it's not an honor code violation.

<P>
An earlier CS70 student who ran into trouble has provided a
<A HREF="statement.html">statement</A> about what happened, which may
help you to avoid the same fate.

<HR>
<H3>Announcements</H3>

<P> Important announcements between classes will be sent out via the
course's electronic mailing list.  (In complex cases, the email may
refer you to the course's web page.)
<STRONG>Be sure you are on the class mailing list.</STRONG>
Check your email regularly,
particularly right before an assignment is due (when any bugs are
likely emerge and be corrected).

<HR>
<H3>Attendance, Excuses, Late Homeworks, Etc.</H3>

<P>
You are expected to be in class most of the time.  I'm not going to
take attendance explicitly.  However, if you aren't in class, it's
your responsibility to find out what happened, and if you are gone a
lot, it will impact your grade.

<P>
Unless announced, there are no automatic extensions to homework (or
other) deadlines, and a grading penalty <EM>will</EM> be exacted for
late submissions (see the <A HREF="homework-grading.html#late">homework
grading guidelines</A> for details).  If, for some good reason, you
are unable to turn in
a homework when due, extensions may be possible.  
The key principles are:

<UL>
    <LI> Tell me promptly (either directly or via someone like the Dean of
	Students) that you have a problem.  The meaning of "prompt" depends on 
	the nature of the excuse.  I don't expect phone calls from the ER!
    <LI> Negotiate appropriate
	arrangements with me.  Don't just turn in material late.
    <LI> I won't allow you to get systematically behind in the
	course unless you have the kind of excuse (e.g. major sickness)
	that would allow you to get an Incomplete at the end of the term.
    <LI> We have to arrange things in ways that don't create unnecessary
	problems for the graders (who have their own courses to
	worry about).
    <LI> In some cases, I may accept a late assignment but still deduct points.
</UL>

<P>
If you think it is impossible to accomplish the work in the available
time, consult with me before the due date.  It may be that everyone in
the class has
the same problem, in which case I might want to adjust the assignment.
The same applies if I have scheduled something at a particularly bad
time (e.g. simultaneously with a major deadline for another class)
or if there seems to be a bug in an assignment.

<H3>Sickness</H3>

<P>
If you get sick during the term, let me know <EM>immediately</EM>,
even if you think it will not affect your work.  This applies any time
you are sick enough that you miss any classes (not just this one),
need extra sleep, or find yourself thinking more slowly than normal.
Notify me of sickness even if you're 100% sure that you'll be able to
get your work done on time.
