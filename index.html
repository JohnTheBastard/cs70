<P>
<STRONG>Please do not leave voice-mail messages regarding CS70
questions.</STRONG>  If you cannot reach someone, send mail to
<A HREF="mailto:cs70help@cs.hmc.edu">cs70help</A> instead.

<P>
You can always get help from the graders and the professor by sending
mail to <A HREF="mailto:cs70help@cs.hmc.edu">cs70help@cs.hmc.edu</A>.
This is a good way to report problems or to get quick help on a
homework question.
<STRONG>DO NOT</STRONG> send mail to <CODE>cs70grad</CODE> to get
help.  Mail to this account will never be answered promptly, and usually
will not be answered at all.
<STRONG>DO NOT SEND MAIL DIRECTLY TO YOUR PROFESSOR.  YOU SHOULD ONLY
SEND MAIL TO THE PROFESSOR IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE THAT YOU WANT TO HIDE
FROM THE GRADERS, SUCH AS REPORTING AN HONOR-CODE VIOLATION.</STRONG>

<H3>Finding Geoff</H3>

<P>
My <A HREF="geoff-schedule.html">weekly schedule</A> is posted on the Web
for all to see.
I am generally in my office every day except Friday.  If the door is
open, please feel free to drop in with your questions.  Even if I
happen to be busy, I'll at least know that you need to talk to me and
we can set up an appointment to talk.  If you are on a computer, the
command <CODE>finger @mallet</CODE> will generally tell you whether
I'm logged in and have multiple active windows, which is a <EM>very</EM> good
sign that I'm in the office.

<P>
As a general rule, the <CODE>talk</CODE> utility is <EM>not</EM> a
good way to reach me, regardless of what machine you are trying to
reach me at.  I usually keep my command windows closed and my bell
disabled, so I will never see the talk request.

<P>
I will normally try to be in my office in the evening on Wednesdays
when an assignment is due.  You can e-mail me, call me (x71610), or
stop by with your questions.

<P>
On Fridays I do research.  You can sometimes reach me by
calling 310-267-5645, though you'll rarely get an answer between 1 and
3 PM, when I'm in meetings.  In general, if I'm available to answer
the phone, I'm also available to answer questions.  If you can't get
me by phone, send <A HREF="mailto:geoff@cs.hmc.edu">e-mail</A>.

<H2><A NAME="content">Catalog Description</A></H2>

<P>
<EM>Note: the following catalog description is outdated.  It will be
replaced with the current description when possible.</EM>
Abstract data types including priority queues, dynamic dictionaries,
and disjoint sets.  Efficient data structures for these data types,
including heaps, self-balancing trees, and hash tables. Analysis of
data structures including worst-case, average-case, and amortized
analysis.  Storage reclamation and secondary storage
considerations. Extensive practice in implementing these data
structures in several languages for a variety of
applications. 

<P>
What's really covered:
as with most courses, the catalog description isn't 100% accurate.  A
better description of what we cover is:

<P>
Major features of the C++ language, including pointers, classes,
templates, and operator overloading.  Programming style.
Extensive practice in
professional-quality programming.  Abstract data types and data
structures, including arrays, lists, stacks, queues, dequeue, dynamic
dictionaries.  Efficient data structures for these data types,
including arrays, lists, trees, self-balancing trees, hash tables, and
B-trees.  Memory management.  Practical aspects of using data
structures in programs.  Analysis of data structures, including
worst-case, average-case, and amortized analysis.

<P>
Prerequisites: Computer Science 60.
<BR>
3 credit hours.

<H2>Goals</H2>

<P>
In this course, you should learn

<UL>
    <LI> Standard features of C++.
    <LI> Basics of programming style.
    <LI> How to properly comment and document your code, so that other
	people can understand it easily.
    <LI> How to use, and when to use, a range of common data structures
	(e.g. lists, arrays, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables,
	balanced trees, ...).
    <LI> How to manage memory:  allocation, deallocation
	and where to allocate (heap, stack).
    <LI> How to use pointers.
    <LI> Basic Unix software development tools (makefiles, header files, ...).
</UL>

<P>
You will also get lots of practice writing software, including
some fairly large programs, so as to improve your coding skills
and speed.

<H2><A NAME="assignments">Homework Assignments</A></H2>

<P>
There will be 11 homework assignments.  Most will take 1 week,
but you will be given 2 weeks to complete a few of them, due either to
difficulty or to other factors such as school breaks.
Assignments will be posted in the <A HREF="cal.html">class calendar</A>.
<STRONG>Note that the calendar link is placed on the homework <EM>due
date</EM>!</STRONG>
Assignments will normally be due on Wednesday evenings at 9 P.M.
See the
<A HREF="homework-policies.html">homework policies</A> and
<A HREF="homework-grading.html"> homework grading guidelines</A>
pages for general information on homework.  There is also a page of
